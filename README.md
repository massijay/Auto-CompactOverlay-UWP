# Auto-CompactOverlay-UWP
A sample code to demonstrate how to implement the automatic switch to CompactOverlay View Mode when the main window of the uwp app loses focus.
Also, the app calculates the aspect ratio of the content (e.g. an image) and saves the size of the compact window so the user can switch in or out very fast.
